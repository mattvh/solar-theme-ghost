Solar Theme for Ghost
=====================

### A fork from [mattvh/solar-theme-ghost](https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-ghost)

What's added ?
--------

- Improve stylesheet. Images in the mobile broswer will display well.
- Using `background-image` instead of `<img />` tag. More flexible.
- Optional Google Analytics and Disqus module. 
- Add image gallery feature, using [blueimp-gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery)


How to enable Google Analytics and Disqus ?
--------

Using your favorite editor, and edit the `default.hbs` file, find

```javascript
  var setting = {
    disqusShortName: '',
    ga: ''
  };
```
and set the properties to your disqus short name and your google analytics track code.
After saving the file, you need to restart the ghost server, to make the changes work. And then all done!

A stylish theme for [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) blogs, based on the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette.

Features
--------

* **Two color schemes** — One for Solarized Dark and one for Solarized Light. Just swap the reference to the `colors-dark.css` file with `colors-light.css` if you don't like light-on-dark.
* **Responsive Design** — Solarized adapts to fit any screen size.


Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository and upload the `solar` directory to your Ghost blog's `content/themes` folder.

2. Go to the Settings page of the Ghost backend and select `solar` from the Theme dropdown.

3. There is no step 3.


Customization
-------------

Solar supports Ghost's logo and cover image features, and will work perfectly fine with or without them. If you wish to upload a cover image, it will appear above the rest of the page. An uploaded logo replaces the textual blog name. (If you later decide you don't want a logo or cover image, you can remove it by clicking on the appropriate option in Settings and selecting the trash can icon.)


Syntax Higlighting
------------------

Solar uses [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting, which works in tandem with fenced Markdown code blocks like so:

	```language-javascript
	var t = new Thing("Test!");
	```

Valid language classes include `language-markup`, `language-css`, `language-javascript`, `language-ruby`, and `language-php`. Prism.js supports a large range of additional languages (most of which have been included in Solar), as well as generic support for C-like languages.

To-Do
-----

* The Jekyll version of Solar has linkblog support, while the Ghost one does not. This is because there isn't a finalized plugin API for Ghost yet, and there is no built-in linkblogging or post meta feature as of yet. This may change as Ghost's feature set is filled out more.
